# E-commerce Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an E-commerce dataset using data science techniques. The objective is to extract meaningful insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Steps Involved

### Step 1: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of studying and exploring datasets to understand their main characteristics, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables. EDA is typically conducted as a preliminary step before performing formal statistical analysis or modeling.

#### Steps to perform EDA:

1. **Data Loading and Basic Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset and examine its shape (number of rows and columns).

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Conduct descriptive statistics to obtain:
     - Count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum
     - 25%, 50%, 75% percentiles
     - Data types of each column

3. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Identify and handle any missing (NaN/Null) values in the dataset.

4. **Identify Duplicate Records**:
   - Locate and remove duplicate records from the dataset.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new columns to adjust the dataset for meaningful insights.

6. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analyze correlations between different data fields to discover relationships and dependencies.

7. **Age Distribution Visualization**:
   - Visualize the distribution of Customer's age using appropriate plots.

8. **Skewness and Kurtosis Calculation**:
   - Calculate skewness (measure of symmetry) and kurtosis (heavy-tailed or light-tailed) of the data.

9. **Outlier Treatment**:
   - Identify and treat outliers that significantly deviate from the rest of the data.

10. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - Conduct hypothesis testing to evaluate the significance of the model building.

### Step 2: Divide Data into Input and Output

- Create `X` as the input (independent variables) and `y` as the output (dependent variable).

### Step 3: Split Data into Train and Test Sets

To ensure our model works effectively, we need to train it first and then test it. We will divide the data into two parts:

- **Training Data (80%)**
- **Testing Data (20%)**

This will give us `XTraining`, `XTesting`, `yTraining`, and `yTesting`.

### Step 4: Implement Different Machine Learning Models

Since our output variable is binary (i.e., only two valid results), we will employ binary classification techniques. Binary classification is a supervised learning algorithm that categorizes new observations into one of two classes.

#### Common Techniques to Consider:

- **Naive Bayes Model** (Bernoulli Naive Bayes)
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Bagging Decision Tree**
- **Boosted Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest Algorithm**

We will use these techniques to identify the best-fit model for the dataset and compare their results.

## Conclusion

This capstone project aims to provide a thorough understanding of E-commerce data analysis through EDA and machine learning modeling. The insights gained from this project can help drive strategic decisions in the E-commerce sector.
